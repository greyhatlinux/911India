## The Problem Statement :
Interactive & user friendly map application
for the public to inform police about the
crimes and emergencies in real time.

### Digging the Problem Statement
* Interactive and user-friendly UI
* Map enabled solution
* Real-time crime reporting
* Emergency Reporting

### Our system architecture has 4 endpoints:
1. Reporter
2. Other people
3. PCR
4. Headquarters


#### Roadmap :
![endpoints](/images/1.png)

#### Step 1 :
The user downloads the App into his
smartphone.
It requires no initial set-up or any sort of
user registration. The app provides
hassle-free UX.
Upon launching the app and clicking
the help me button, an immediate
response will be sent to the nearest
Police Station and then to all nearby
PCRs.

#### Step 2 :
The request document which arrives to
the Police HQ will contain the
requesterâ€™s IP address, high precision
Lat-Long coordinates and other vital
information for proper identification.
In areas of low network connectivity,
and unavailability of internet, the
Lat-Long will be sent via text-based
messages.

#### Step 3 :
Upon receiving help request, all the
PCRs in the range of 5km radius will
get notified.
The app with the PCR will clearly show
the location of incoming help request,
along with the nearest route to him.
